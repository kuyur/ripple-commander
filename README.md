# ripple-commander
A command line client for ripple trading. Now ripple-commander is using Ripple REST API.

If you appreciate the work, welcome donate some xrp to `rscxz5PqRrmUaMigyb1mP32To1rQDygxAq` .

## Usage
1. Install nodejs (>=4.0.0).
2. Checkout the source code.

        git clone https://github.com/kuyur/ripple-commander.git

3. Download necessary node modules.

        cd ripple-commander
        npm install

4. Before running the commander, you should copy `config.json.sample` and rename the new file to `config.json`. Use a text editor to open `config.json`, edit the `server` field to your private or trusted one. If you trust Ripple Labs 100%, you still can use the default configuration(`https://api.ripple.com/v1`) until it is shutdown.
 
5. Run commander. Account (ripple address) and secret will be required and saved to `wallet.txt` for the first time.

        node start-commander.js

6. Type **help** to see available commands. Press **Ctrl+C** to exit.
